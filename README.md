# Donation-platform
The website aims to be a platform that facilitates the process of fund raising by NGO's while also facilitating the charity efforts of various philanthropists around the globe.
More specifically, Organizations will be able to make Organizations accounts that can raise funds through the website while also advertising themselves and Donators can make Donators accounts to donate to organizations. The platform also functions as a social media where Donators and Organizations can publish posts, comment on posts, like other posts and follow other users. Organizations will be able to raise funds through the creation of events to which any user can donate to, whereby any donated funds go to the organization behind each event.
